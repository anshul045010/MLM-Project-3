# Overview
This project aims to conduct customer segmentation using supervised machine learning techniques, particularly Decision Trees and Random Forests, on a dataset containing vehicle data. The dataset encompasses diverse attributes including selling price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and owner status. Through classification, the goal is to effectively categorize customers into segments based on their characteristics, enabling targeted marketing strategies and personalized customer experiences.
# Project Objectives
# Problem Statements
1. Classification of Customer Data into Segments using Cross-Validation
2. Classification of Customer Data into Segments using Ensemble Methods
3. Determination of an Appropriate Classification Model
4. Identification of Important Features and their Thresholds for Classification
